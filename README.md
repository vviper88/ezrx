# ezrx

### Open-source web-accessible SDR software, aiming to be as simple and as lightweight as possible.

ezrx was born when I was tuning around on an SDR website and thought that I could at least *try* to make a more lightweight version.

## What problems I hope to fix with ezrx

#### Note: Before you read this, keep in mind that I have nothing against other SDR software. I use them daily. These are just the small complaints I have.

1. Too many modes available. A significant percentage of available modes in software are used by almost nobody for their actual purpose.

2. Too much focus on UI. A user will likely have a much easier experience if what they see is what they get.

3. Stuttering. I can't exactly promise this one, as I am limited by Internet protocols. Tuning on a radio does not naturally come with interruptions. There is either a signal or static.

4. Resource use. I wish to make ezrx as easy to run as possible on a variety of systems.

5. Trying to implement things that simply would either not work or not be favorable while over an internet connection. An example being a spectrum view (not a waterfall), all the ones I've seen have a very low framerate and are generally just not appealing.

6. Obscure configuration files. I don't want to go looking through /etc/thissdrsoftware/ searching for the .conf file to change a bandplan.

To be continued...

## General goals, which are not included in the above section.

- Have a somewhat usable, not pretty, but at least usable, version out before I am on summer vacation.
